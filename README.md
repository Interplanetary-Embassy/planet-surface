## Interplanetary Surfaces

Todo:

* Create wrapper functions for "generating" planet surfaces
* Create wrapper functions for "fetching" stored planet surfaces
* Full screen loading until planet surface fully loaded
* Alternative "can't find landing area" for any failures
* 4 layers of parrallax (moon, mountains X 2, island) based on cursor
* Use specific configuration settings based on URL ?coords=1,2,3
* Introduce full responsiveness ...
* __Only then can we look at smart contracts__
